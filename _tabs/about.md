Software architect, open-source enthusiast, automation lover.

One of my fondest memories traces back to the moment when, as a child, I played for the first time Ghostbusters on the Commodore 64. I like to think that my fascination for computers started with the game's multi-coloured loading screen, and that is why I've made a career in the IT world.

As a long-time open-source developer, I've embraced collaboration, shared knowledge, and the power of community-driven innovation.

My specialities include: quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, test-driven development, automation, designing continuous integration and continuous delivery systems, python development, and disaster recovery for Postgres, just to name some.

When not behind a computer screen, I love to cook (because I'm Italian), drink coffee (no, you cannot have a cappuccino after 11 AM!), playing video games (in the end everything started because of them) and playing as a DJ.
