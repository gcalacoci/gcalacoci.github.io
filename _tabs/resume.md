Giulio Calacoci
===============

Principal DevOps Architect at EDB
---------------------------------

Software architect, open-source enthusiast, automation lover.

One of my fondest memories traces back to the moment when, as a child, I played for the first time Ghostbusters on the Commodore 64. I like to think that my fascination for computers started with the game's multi-coloured loading screen, and that is why I've made a career in the IT world.

As a long-time open-source developer, I've embraced collaboration, shared knowledge, and the power of community-driven innovation.

My specialities include: quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, test-driven development, automation, designing continuous integration and continuous delivery systems, python development, and disaster recovery for Postgres, just to name some.

When not behind a computer screen, I love to cook (because I'm Italian), drink coffee (no, you cannot have a cappuccino after 11 AM!), playing video games (in the end everything started because of them) and playing as a DJ.

### Work

#### [EDB](https://www.linkedin.com/company/edbpostgres/)

##### Principal DevOps Architect

Sep 2020 â€“ Present

After EDB acquired 2ndQuadrant, I had a pivotal role in the process of merging the software delivery infrastructures of both companies. Thanks to my previous job as Continuous Delivery manager, I worked on unifying and standardising how software is built in EDB, designing and developing a cloud continuous delivery framework based on GitHub actions, AWS and Cloudsmith as packages distribution platform. The result is a fully automated pipeline that builds and publishes packages for all supported platforms (RHEL, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, SLES, Windows, macOS) and architectures (x86\_64, aarch64, ppc64le, s390x) for all EDB products. I've been a primary player in the process of migrating all the products to the new system, and I've engineered the structure of the new repositories. I'm still an active contributor to the open-source project Barman.

##### Continuous Delivery Manager

Sep 2016 â€“ Sep 2020

Prato, Tuscany, Italy

At 2ndQuadrant, we had multiple products, all with different build requirements. The process of building packages for testing and release purposes spanned multiple days, and uploading the packages to a repository that the customer could access was not automated, ad-hoc and error-prone. I developed a Continuous Delivery framework based on Jenkins that standardized the package building process, accommodating the diverse build and testing requirements for the various products on all supported distributions, and provided a secure automated package signing and publishing mechanism. This system served all the 2ndQuadrant development teams, most of whom were not familiar with CI/CD practices. The CI/CD framework enabled 2ndQuadrant to reduce the release process from days to hours, ensuring a high degree of quality and timely delivered software products

##### PostgreSQL consultant

Aug 2011 â€“ Sep 2020

I Specialised in designing and developing high-performance database solutions using PostgreSQL. My field of expertise was disaster recovery, and I provided consultancy, training and support for clients in times of crisis. I participated in multiple conferences and meetups as a Disaster recovery evangelist, sensitizing the community about the importance of having a disaster recovery plan, backups and restore procedures. I actively participated in the Italian postgresql community as a member of the ItPUG, the Italian PostgreSQL User Group, helping organise the PGDay.IT conferences.

##### Python Developer

Aug 2011 â€“ Sep 2020

As a Python developer, I've crafted solutions for diverse internal and open-source projects. I'm a core developer for the Barman project, and I have actively contributed to advancing PostgreSQL and Python's capabilities in the disaster recovery field. I've participated in multiple PyCon Italian conferences and at EuroPycon as a speaker, talking about PostgreSQL, Python, disaster recovery, continuous integration and foreign data wrappers.

#### Devise.IT s.r.l

##### Software Analyst

Apr 2009 â€“ Aug 2011

As a Software Analyst, I worked using Java, javascript and PHP languages. I specialized in both frontend and backend development, using technologies like Spring framework, Struts, PostgreSQL, Hibernate, Symfony, Drupal and multiple javascript libraries like jQuery. My expertise lies in seamlessly integrating these technologies to create robust, efficient, and scalable web applications. My experience in application development spans different industries like e-commerce, automotive, and finance. Whether optimizing backend logic or refining the user experience on the front end, I delivered high-quality solutions satisfying customer needs.

#### grafica-web

##### chief web application developer

Mar 2008 â€“ Feb 2009

As a Chief Web Application Developer, I led a small and dynamic team responsible for crafting the front end of our company's core business application based on PHP, javascript, HTML and CSS. With a rich background in web development, I've steered the team towards creating impactful digital experiences, ensuring that our applications not only meet but exceed industry standards.

#### Basis

##### Help Desk Technician

Sep 2002 â€“ Aug 2003

Having served as a Desk Side Support Technician at Nuova Pignone Firenze, a subsidiary of General Electric, I specialized in delivering top-notch technical assistance to both Italian and foreign users.

This talk is about a love story. The perfect love between PostgreSQL and Python.

PostgreSQL is the default database choice for many Python developers, because it is robust, stable and open source. In 2ndQuadrant, we breathe PostgreSQL and we love python too, using it as much as possible for internal and external open source projects. We want to share our love for python and PostgreSQL and how they work together. So let us tell you a real love story!
